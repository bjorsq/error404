Error 404 was a commission from e-2 for a project they were doing called Containership where they were asking artists who weren't digital   artists. I'd never been on the web before, so the project was partly about a na√Øve navigation of cyber space and I tried to treat the internet   as the real world, a physical space. I started surfing by taking some addresses from the bookmarks on a public library computer, random   starting points in cyberspace, and I just let one website lead me to another. I worked with Pete Edwards to compose an animation of all these different fragments to tell this story. The piece is a 20 minute duration 'composition', and isn't interactive; the pop up and moving windows fill up each viewer's desktop, rendering the viewer more passive than usual. There is a central text that types out the main story letter by letter , and the other images and texts pop onto the screen and move around, seemingly taking over the desktop. I made a diagram/drawing to map out the composition for Pete and that has been shown in Amsterdam. The website was launched at the Lux in London.

error404 - REDUX
----------------

The original error404 started to break a few years it's inception, when browser vendors started to tighten up security around pop-up windows by requiring then to display the address bar and status bar. As error404 used popup windows of varying sizes, placed them around the screen and animated them, the increase in area occupied by window features started to impact the way it operated. A number of years later, popup window blockers became commonplace, and are now built into most browsers. These prevent "unsolicited" popups (all the popups in error404 are unsolicited!).
