Error 404 was a commission from e-2 for a project they were doing called Containership where they were asking artists who weren't digital   artists. I'd never been on the web before, so the project was partly about a na√Øve navigation of cyber space and I tried to treat the internet   as the real world, a physical space. I started surfing by taking some addresses from the bookmarks on a public library computer, random   starting points in cyberspace, and I just let one website lead me to another. I worked with Pete Edwards to compose an animation of all these different fragments to tell this story. The piece is a 20 minute duration 'composition', and isn't interactive; the pop up and moving windows fill up each viewer's desktop, rendering the viewer more passive than usual. There is a central text that types out the main story letter by letter , and the other images and texts pop onto the screen and move around, seemingly taking over the desktop. I made a diagram/drawing to map out the composition for Pete and that has been shown in Amsterdam. The website was launched at the Lux in London.
