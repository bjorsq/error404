  Error 404 was a commission from e-2 for a project they were doing
  called Containership where they were asking artists who weren't digital
  artists. I'd never been on the web before, so the project was partly
  about a na√Øve navigation of cyber space and I tried to treat the internet
  as the real world, a physical space. I started surfing by taking some
  addresses from the bookmarks on a public library computer, random 
  starting points in cyberspace, and I just let one website lead me 
  to another. I worked with Pete Edwards to compose an animation of all 
  these different fragments to tell this story. The piece is a 20 minute 
  duration 'composition', and isn't interactive; the pop up and moving 
  windows fill up each viewer's desktop, rendering the viewer more passive 
  than usual. There is a central text that types out the main story letter 
  by letter , and the other images and texts pop onto the screen and move 
  around, seemingly taking over the desktop. I made a diagram/drawing to 
  map out the composition for Pete and that has been shown in Amsterdam.
  The website was launched at the Lux in London.
