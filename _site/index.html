There is a central text that types out the main story letter  by letter , and the other images and texts pop onto the screen and move  around, seemingly taking over the desktop. I made a diagram/drawing to  map out the composition for Pete and that has been shown in Amsterdam. The website was launched at the Lux in London.">
